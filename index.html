      <li>Throwing litter away</li>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <section class="side-by-side">
      <p>Litter often ends up in rivers when it is not thrown away properly.Throwing rubbish on the ground or into stormwater drains allows rainwater to carry the litter through the drainage system into rivers.For example:in Alex they throw dirty water and litter in the streets which result in a dirty environment that can get children sick. Plastic can stay in our environment for hundreds of years and can harm water.</p>

    <h2>Recycling as the solution</h2>
    <section class="side-by-side">
      <img class="recycle-image" src="recycle.jpg" alt="">
      <section>
        <p>Use less plastic and recycle.Never pour oils;paints;medicines or chamicals down drains.They end up in our
          water.Leave your trash in place so that the recycling truck can collect it. </p>
        <p>Say "NO" to things you do not really need or would not use.Buy less product and try not to shop too
          often.Find creative ways to use things again instead of throwing them away.Learn which items can be recycled
          and put them in the recycling bins</p>
